                <h2>Deathbed</h2>
                <pre>
As I lie here on my deathbed
I can't help but feel a sense of gladness
For though my time on earth is ending
I am surrounded by love and joy

My loved ones are all around me
Holding my hand and wiping my brow
Their love and care have been a comfort
As I journey towards the great unknown

I am at peace with my passing
For I have lived a rich and full life
I am grateful for the memories
That I will take with me into the night

So as I take my final breath
I do so with a heart full of love
And the knowledge that I will be forever
Missed but never forgotten

Goodbye, dear world, and thank you
For all the beauty and happiness
You have brought into my life.

                <h2>Rainy Days</h2>
                <pre>Rainy days, oh how they shine
Bringing joy and peace of mind
The world outside is fresh and new
As the rain washes away the dew

The pitter patter of the rain
Is a cheerful sound that fills my ears
It's a chance to dance and sing
And let go of all my fears

So I put on my raincoat and boots
And head out into the pouring rain
I twirl and spin and jump and play
Feeling alive and free again

For rainy days are meant to be celebrated
A time to laugh and let our spirits roam
So let the rain fall, let it pour
For in this moment, we are free to explore

The world is ours on a rainy day
So let's embrace it, come what may
For in the rain, there is beauty and wonder
And the chance to feel alive and full of thunder.</pre>

                <h2>Life</h2>
                <pre>Life is a precious gift, oh so rare
A chance to love and laugh and care
To explore the world and all it has to offer
To live each day to the very fullest

So let us not take a single moment for granted
But embrace each day with open hearts and minds
Let us seek out joy and happiness
And leave behind the worries and strife

For every single day is a chance to live
To love and laugh and learn and give
To create memories that will last a lifetime
And to find meaning in this journey of mine

So let us make the most of every single day
For tomorrow is not promised, it's true
But today is ours, to do with as we please
So let's live it to the very fullest, my friend, and seize

The opportunity to be happy, to be free
To follow our dreams and make them a reality
For every single day is a chance to shine
So let's make the most of it, one day at a time.</pre>

                <h2>Grim Repear</h2>
                <pre>Grim Reaper, oh so dreary,
Feeling lost and feeling weary.
No joy in life, no light in sight,
Only darkness, only night.

Grim Reaper, once so proud,
Now feeling lost, feeling cowed.
No purpose left, no meaning found,
Feeling empty, feeling bound.

But even in the darkest days,
There is hope, there is a way.
With courage, strength, and a little grace,
We can lift the veil, we can find our place.

So Grim Reaper, take heart,
There is so much more for you to start.
A new beginning, a fresh start,
A chance to find joy, a chance to find art.</pre>

                <h2>Steampunk age</h2>
                <pre>In a world of gears and steam,
Where brass and copper gleam,
The Steampunk Age has come to be,
A place of wonder, a place to see.

The steam engines roar and whine,
As they power the machines in time,
The airships soar through the skies,
Soaring higher, reaching new heights.

The Victorian era's influence,
Is evident in every instance,
But with a twist of science fiction,
A world of possibility, a world of conviction.

The Steampunk Age is a place to explore,
A world of fantasy, a world of lore,
So come and join the adventure,
In this world of steam and splendor.</pre>

                <h2>Sad love</h2>
                <pre>The wind whispers softly,
As the rain falls from the sky.
Tears streaming down my face,
As I say goodbye.

I stand alone in the darkness,
As the world passes by.
My heart heavy with sorrow,
As I watch the love of my life die.

The pain is too much to bear,
As I fall to my knees.
I cry out to the heavens,
As I beg for some kind of release.

But there is no solace,
No comfort to be found.
I am left with nothing,
But the memory of your sound.

I will love you forever,
Even in death you remain.
But the pain of your absence,
Is a constant, aching pain.

I am but a shadow of my former self,
A shell of what I used to be.
Without you by my side,
I am lost and incomplete.

So I stand here, in the rain,
As the world moves on without you.
And I am left with nothing,
But the saddest love that ever was true.</pre>
